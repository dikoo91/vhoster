# About vHoster

vHoster was initialised to avoid time wasting when you are creating new virtual hosts in GNU/Linux.

Project is still in Beta stage and WIP, but feel free to test and share your ideas and bug reports with me here, on GitHub Issues page.

Readme is WIP too :P

## Roadmap

* Add checking for running script as super user
* Add system /etc/hosts file modification
* Check if lampp (xampp) was installed
* Check if vhosts support is enabled in Apache

Any other ideas are welcome!
